We analyze the temporal and topical signature of users' sharing behaviour, showing how they exhibit distinct behaviorial patterns on different networks. We also examine cross-sharing (i.e., the act of user broadcasting their activity to multiple OSNs near-simultaneously), a previously-unstudied behaviour and demonstrate how certain OSNs play the roles of originating source and destination sinks.},

abstract = {An online user joins multiple social networks in order to enjoy different services. On each joined social network, she creates an identity and constitutes its three major dimensions namely profile, content and connection network. She largely governs her identity formulation on any social network and therefore can manipulate multiple aspects of it. With no global identifier to mark her presence uniquely in the online domain, her online identities remain unlinked, isolated and difficult to search. Literature has proposed identity search methods on the basis of profile attributes, but has left the other identity dimensions e.g. content and network, unexplored. In this work, we introduce two novel identity search algorithms based on content and network attributes and improve on traditional identity search algorithm based on profile attributes of a user. We apply proposed identity search algorithms to find a user's identity on Facebook, given her identity on Twitter. We report that a combination of proposed identity search algorithms found Facebook identity for 39% of Twitter users searched while traditional method based on profile attributes found Facebook identity for only 27.4%. Each proposed identity search algorithm access publicly accessible attributes of a user on any social network. We deploy an identity resolution system, Finding Nemo, which uses proposed identity search methods to find a Twitter user's identity on Facebook. We conclude that inclusion of more than one identity search algorithm, each exploiting distinct dimensional attributes of an identity, helps in improving the accuracy of an identity resolution process.},

abstract = {The current Online Social Networks' infrastructure is com- posed by thousands of servers distributed across data-centers spread over several geographical locations. These servers store all the users' information (profile, contacts, contents, etc). Such an infrastructure incurs high operational and maintenance costs. Furthermore, thismay threaten the scal- ability, the reliability, the availability and the privacy of the offered service. On the other hand this centralized approach gives to the OSN provider full control over a huge amount of valuable information. This information constitutes the basis of the OSN provider's business. Most of the storage capacity is dedicated to store the user's content (e.g. photos, videos, etc). We believe that OSN provider does not have strong incentive to dedicate a large part of its infrastructure to store majority part of this content. In this position paper we introduce the concept of user assisted Online Social Network (uaOSN). This novel archi- tecture seeks to distribute the storage load associated to the content (e.g. photos, videos, etc) among the OSN's users. Thus the OSN provider keeps the control on the relevant in- formation while reducing the operational and maintenance costs. We discuss the benefits that this proposal may pro- duce for both, the OSN provider and the users. We also discuss the technical aspects to be considered and compare this solution to other distributed approaches.},

This is an important area of research as it could save many computation cycles and thus allow accurate information provided to the right people at the right time. Two considerations when forming a data warehouse are data cleansing (including entity resolution) and with schema integration (including record linkage). Uncleansed and fragmented data requires time to decipher and may lead to increased costs for an organization, so data cleansing and schema integration can save a great many (human) computation cycles and can lead to higher organizational efficiency. In this study we survey the literature for the methodologies proposed or developed for entity resolution and record linkage. This survey provides a foundation for solving many problems in data warehousing. For instance, little or no research has been directed at the problem of maintenance of cleansed and linked relations.},

In this paper, we investigate efficient ways of identifying users across such heterogeneous data sources. We present a MapReduce-based framework called Automatic User Identification (AUI) which is easy to deploy and can scale to very large data set. Our framework is based on a novel similarity measure called the signal based similarity (SIG) which measures the similarity of users' trajectories gathered from different data sources, typically with very different sampling rates and noise patterns. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations, which show that our framework outperforms the existing methods significantly. Our study on one hand provides an effective approach for the mobility data integration problem on large scale data sets, i.e., combining the mobility data sets from different sources in order to enhance the data quality. On the other hand, our study provides an in-depth investigation for the widely studied human mobility uniqueness problem under heterogeneous data sources.},

abstract = {In recent years, privacy preserving data mining has become an important problem because of the large amount of personal data which is tracked by many business applications. In many cases, users are unwilling to provide personal information unless the privacy of sensitive information is guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a new framework for privacy preserving data mining of multi-dimensional data. Previous work for privacy preserving data mining uses a perturbation approach which reconstructs data distributions in order to perform the mining. Such an approach treats each dimension independently and therefore ignores the correlations between the different dimensions. In addition, it requires the development of a new distribution based algorithm for each data mining problem, since it does not use the multi-dimensional records, but uses aggregate distributions of the data as input. This leads to a fundamental re-design of data mining algorithms. In this paper, we will develop a new and flexible approach for privacy preserving data mining which does not require new problem-specific algorithms, since it maps the original data set into a new anonymized data set. This anonymized data closely matches the characteristics of the original data including the correlations among the different dimensions. We present empirical results illustrating the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {With the advent of GPS-equipped devices, a massive amount of location data is being collected, raising the issue of the privacy risks incurred by the individuals whose movements are recorded. In this work, we focus on a specific inference attack called the de-anonymization attack, by which an adversary tries to infer the identity of a particular individual behind a set of mobility traces. More specifically, we propose an implementation of this attack based on a mobility model called Mobility Markov Chain (MMC). An MMC is built out from the mobility traces observed during the training phase and is used to perform the attack during the testing phase. We design several distance metrics quantifying the closeness between two MMCs and combine these distances to build de-anonymizers that can re-identify users. Experiments conducted on real datasets demonstrate that the attack is both accurate and resilient to sanitization mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Thirty-two islands and 5 mainland areas were chosen for the study. Three species of hiber-nators, Eutamias minimum, Tamias striatus and Zapus hudsonias were taken on the mainland with only the Zapus being found on the islands. All six of the non-hibernating species taken were found on the islands. These include Microtus pennsylvanicus, Synaptomys cooper, Clethriono-mys gapperi, Peromyscus rncaniculatus, Blarina brevicauda and Sorex cinereus. The degree of occupancy changed from 4 out of 21 islands in 1950 to 21 of 24 islands in 1952. Along with this increase in the proportion of islands occupied there was an increase in the number of species found on most of the islands although the average number of species found on each occupied island did not change apprecia-bly. This increase in islands occupied was cor-related with an increase in the density of the main-land populations. The water seemed to be an efficient barrier to travel during the summer but the ice of winter became a highway for dispersal of the various non-hibernating species in the winter. Considerable difference was found in the vulner-ability of the several species to trapping. The Perornyscus were readily caught. The Clethri-onomys were not as easy to capture as the former but were still readily taken. The Microtus, how-ever, posed a different problem. They were diffi-cult to capture and on two islands of about 2.2 and 4 acres respectively we were not able to elim--inate them after 16 days of trapping on a 15-foot grid. The populations of small mammals fluctuate quite widely and the several populations appear to be somewhat independent of each other. The islands appeared to lag behind the mainland in the development of their populations. REFERENCES Errington, P. L. 1946. Predation and vertebrate pop-ulations. Quart. Rev.

An important requirement for such techniques is to ensure anonymization of data while at the same time minimizing the information loss resulting from data modifications. In this paper we propose an approach that uses the idea of clustering to minimize information loss and thus ensure good data quality. The key observation here is that data records that are naturally similar to each other should be part of the same equivalence class. We thus formulate a specific clustering problem, referred to as k-member clustering problem. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and present a greedy heuristic, the complexity of which is in O(n2). As part of our approach we develop a suitable metric to estimate the information loss introduced by generalizations, which works for both numeric and categorical data.},

We examine three specific features on Yelp, Flickr, and Twitter: the geo-location attached to a user's posts, the timestamp of posts, and the user's writing style as captured by language models. We show that among these three features the location of posts is the most powerful feature to identify accounts that belong to the same user in different sites. When we combine all three features, the accuracy of identifying Twitter accounts that belong to a set of Flickr users is comparable to that of existing attacks that exploit usernames. Our attack can identify 37% more accounts than using usernames when we instead correlate Yelp and Twitter. Our results have sig- nificant privacy implications as they present a novel class of attacks that exploit users' tendency to assume that, if they maintain differ- ent personas with different names, the accounts cannot be linked together; whereas we show that the posts themselves can provide enough information to correlate the accounts.},

We show it is possible to identify a mobile user from these records of movement within the network and a pre-existing location profile, based on previous movement. Two different identification processes are studied, and their performances are evaluated on real cell location traces. The best of those allows for the identification of around 80% of users. We also study the misidentified users and characterise them using hierarchical clustering techniques. Our findings highlight the difficulty of anonymizing location data, and firmly establish they are personally identifiable.},

We examine location data gathered from volunteer subjects to quantify how well four different algorithms can identify the subjects home locations and then their identities using a freely available, programmable Web search engine. Our procedure can identify at least a small fraction of the subjects and a larger fraction of their home addresses. We then apply three different obscuration countermeasures designed to foil the privacy attacks: spatial cloaking, noise, and rounding. We show how much obscuration is necessary to maintain the privacy of all the subjects.},

abstract = {Consider a data holder, such as a hospital or a bank, that has a privately held collection of person-specific, field structured data. Suppose the data holder wants to share a version of the data with researchers. How can a data holder release a version of its private data with scientific guarantees that the individuals who are the subjects of the data cannot be re-identified while the data remain practically useful? The solution provided in this paper includes a formal protection model named fc-anonymity and a set of accompanying policies for deployment. A release provides fc-anonymity protection if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least k-\ individuals whose information also appears in the release. This paper also examines re-identification attacks that can be realized on releases that adhere to k- anonymity unless accompanying policies are respected. The fc-anonymity protection model is important because it forms the basis on which the real-world systems known as Datafly, |i-Argus and fc-Similar provide guarantees of privacy protection.},

abstract = {Preserving individual privacy when publishing data is a problem that is receiving increasing attention. According to the fc-anonymity principle, each release of data must be such that each individual is indistinguishable from at least k - 1 other individuals. In this paper we study the problem of anonymity preserving data publishing in moving objects databases. We propose a novel concept of k-anonymity based on co-localization that exploits the inherent uncertainty of the moving object's whereabouts. Due to sampling and positioning systems (e.g., GPS) imprecision, the trajectory of a moving object is no longer a polyline in a three-dimensional space, instead it is a cylindrical volume, where its radius delta represents the possible location imprecision: we know that the trajectory of the moving object is within this cylinder, but we do not know exactly where. If another object moves within the same cylinder they are indistinguishable from each other. This leads to the definition of (k,delta) -anonymity for moving objects databases. We first characterize the (k, delta)-anonymity problem and discuss techniques to solve it. Then we focus on the most promising technique by the point of view of information preservation, namely space translation. We develop a suitable measure of the information distortion introduced by space translation, and we prove that the problem of achieving (k,delta) -anonymity by space translation with minimum distortion is NP-hard. Faced with the hardness of our problem we propose a greedy algorithm based on clustering and enhanced with ad hoc pre-processing and outlier removal techniques. The resulting method, named NWA (Never Walk .Alone), is empirically evaluated in terms of data quality and efficiency. Data quality is assessed both by means of objective measures of information distortion, and by comparing the results of the same spatio-temporal range queries executed on the original database and on the (k, delta)-anonymized one. Experimental -\nresults show that for a wide range of values of delta and k, the relative error introduced is kept low, confirming that NWA produces high quality (k, delta)-anonymized data.},

We explore the trade-off between accuracy and coverage of this method. Further, we explore differences across content received from multiple platforms and devices, and show, for example, that content shared via different sources and applications produces significantly different geographic distributions, and that it is preferred to model and predict location for items according to their source. Our findings show the potential and the bounds of a data-driven approach to assigning location data to short social media texts, and offer implications for all applications that use data-driven approaches to locate content.},

As a consequence, several methods aimed at anonymizing spatio-temporal data before their publication have been proposed in recent years. Such methods are based on a number of underlying privacy models. Among these models, (k,??)-anonymity claims to extend the widely used k-anonymity concept by exploiting the spatial uncertainty ?????0 in the trajectory recording process. In this paper, we prove that, for any ??>0 (that is, whenever there is actual uncertainty), (k,??)-anonymity does not offer trajectory k-anonymity, that is, it does not hide an original trajectory in a set of k indistinguishable anonymized trajectories. Hence, the methods based on (k,??)-anonymity, like Never Walk Alone (NWA) and Wait For Me (W4M) can offer trajectory k-anonymity only when ??=0 (no uncertainty). Thus, the idea of exploiting the recording uncertainty ?? to achieve trajectory k-anonymity with information loss inversely proportional to ?? turns out to be flawed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Online social networks have become popular for communication among people. Previous works on social networks were focused mainly on a single network due to the lack of links from one network to the others. There are several ways to connect different social networks. One possible solution is to find out the same individual who owns accounts for different social networks simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on the problem of linking the same users across different social networks . We start from a basic solution based on profile comparison, which is then im- proved by considering additional social relationships, i.e., friends. Finally, we propose a two-phase clustering method to generate a social summary for each individual. The first phase is to select strongly-connected groups as seeds. The second phase is to assign non-seeds to the clusters based on the social structure and profiles. The final distributions over various clusters are regarded as the social summary. The experiments have been conducted on two real social networking datasets. The experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed (social summary) method, compared to the methods of profile comparison and person-name comparison.},

abstract = {Mobility traces of people and vehicles have been collected and published to assist the design and evaluation of mobilee networks, such as large-scale urban sensing networks. Although the published traces are often made anonymous in that the true identities of nodes are replaced by random identifiers, the privacy concern remains. This is because in real life, nodes are open to observations in public spaces, or they may voluntarily or inadvertently disclose partial knowledge of their whereabouts. Thus, snapshots of nodes' location information can be learned by interested third parties, e.g., directly through chance/engineered meetings between the nodes and their observers, or indirectly through casual conversations or other information sources about people. In this paper, we investigate how an adversary , when equipped with a small amount of the snapshot information termed as side information , can infer an extended view of the whereabouts of a victim node appearing in an anonymous trace. Our results quantify the loss of victim nodes' privacy as a function of the nodal mobility (captured in both real and synthetic traces), the inference strategies of adversaries, and any noise that may appear in the trace or the side information. Generally, our results indicate that the privacy concern is significant in that a relatively small amount of side information is sufficient for the adversary to infer the true identity (either uniquely or with high probability) of a victim in a set of anonymous traces.},

Local ad-hoc networks enable us to sepa- rate an agent's request for location information, the query initiator, fromthe agent that actually requests this service on its behalf, the query requestor. Since a query initiator can select itself or one of the k − 1 agents in its ad-hoc network as a query requestor, the query initiator remains k-anonymous. In addition, the loca- tion revealed to the location service provider is a rectangle instead of an exact coordinate. We develop an anonymous selection algorithm that selects a query requestor with near-uniform randomness, which is a key component to ensure anonymity in an ad-hoc network. Our experiments show that a system can en- sure a high quality of service and maintain a high degree of privacy in terms of anonymity and obfuscation while accessing location-based services.},

abstract = {Location-based social networks are a source of geo-spatial data enriched by textual information, such as news, travel blogs, tweets and user recommendations. Such data may describe an event, an experience or a point of interest that is relevant to a user. In this vision paper we propose to describe a spatial region by the thoughts, ideas and emotions frequently and recently expressed by people in that region. For this purpose, we envision to extract features from geo-textual data, which capture not only the vocabulary, but also current topics and current general interests. We formally define the problem of drawing a socio textual map using geo-textual data and identify the necessary steps towards this vision: We represent each region as a stream of text messages such as tweets. In each region, we maintain a feature representation of text messages. We define a dissimilarity measure between such collections to assess the similarity between two regions. Using this measure, we utilize a metric clustering approach to obtain a social map of similar regions. We present a proof of concept by implementing the aforementioned steps with initial solutions. This proof of concept shows that an initial solution, which clusters the feature representations of regions, also yields clusters having regions that are spatially close. We theoretically explain this proof of concept by Tobler's first law of geography.},

@article{Rossi2015,
abstract = {One of the greatest concerns related to the popularity of GPS-enabled devices and applications is the increasing availability of the personal location information generated by them and shared with application and service providers. Moreover, people tend to have regular routines and be characterized by a set of “significant places”, thus making it possible to identify a user from his/her mobility data. In this paper we present a series of techniques for identifying individuals from their GPS move- ments. More specifically, we study the uniqueness of GPS information for three popular datasets, and we provide a detailed analysis of the discriminatory power of speed, direction and distance of travel. Most importantly, we present a simple yet effective technique for the identification of users from location information that are not included in the original dataset used for training, thus raising important privacy concerns for the management of location datasets.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity and usage of online social media services, people now have accounts (some times several) on multiple and diverse services like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and YouTube. Publicly available information can be used to create a digital footprint of any user using these social media services. Generating such digital footprints can be very useful for personalization, profile management, detecting malicious behavior of users. A very important application of analyzing users' online digital footprints is to protect users from potential privacy and security risks arising from the huge publicly available user information. We extracted information about user identities on different social networks through Social Graph API, FriendFeed, and Profilactic; we collated our own dataset to create the digital footprints of the users. We used username, display name, description, location, profile image, and number of connections to generate the digital footprints of the user. We applied context specific techniques (e.g. Jaro Winkler similarity, Wordnet based ontologies) to measure the similarity of the user profiles on different social networks. We specifically focused on Twitter and LinkedIn. In this paper, we present the analysis and results from applying automated classifiers for disambiguating profiles belonging to the same user from different social networks. UserID and Name were found to be the most discriminative features for disambiguating user profiles. Using the most promising set of features and similarity metrics, we achieved accuracy, precision and recall of 98%, 99%, and 96%, respectively.},

abstract = {The k-anonymity privacy requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class (i.e., a set of records that are indistinguishable from each other with respect to certain ``identifying'' attributes) contains at least k records. Recently, several authors have recognized that k-anonymity cannot prevent attribute disclosure. The notion of l-diversity has been proposed to address this; l-diversity requires that each equivalence class has at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. In this paper we show that l-diversity has a number of limitations. In particular, it is neither necessary nor sufficient to prevent attribute disclosure. We propose a novel privacy notion called t-closeness, which requires that the distribution of a sensitive attribute in any equivalence class is close to the distribution of the attribute in the overall table (i.e., the distance between the two distributions should be no more than a threshold t). We choose to use the earth mover distance measure for our t-closeness requirement. We discuss the rationale for t-closeness and illustrate its advantages through examples and experiments.},

@article{Gonzalez2008,
abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

abstract = {We study fifteen months of human mobility data for one and a half million individuals and find that human mobility traces are highly unique. In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95% of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of linking users across multiple online communities. Specifically, we focus on the alias-disambiguation step of this user linking task, which is meant to differentiate users with the same usernames. We start quantitatively analyzing the importance of the alias-disambiguation step by conducting a survey on 153 volunteers and an experimental analysis on a large dataset of About.me (75,472 users). The analysis shows that the alias-disambiguation solution can address a major part of the user linking problem in terms of the coverage of true pairwise decisions (46.8%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on human behaviors with regards to the usages of online usernames. We then cast the alias-disambiguation step as a pairwise classification problem and propose a novel unsupervised approach. The key idea of our approach is to automatically label training instances based on two observations: (a) rare usernames are likely owned by a single natural person, e.g. pennystar88 as a positive instance; (b) common usernames are likely owned by different natural persons, e.g. tank as a negative instance. We propose using the n-gram probabilities of usernames to estimate the rareness or commonness of usernames. Moreover, these two observations are verified by using the dataset of Yahoo! Answers. The empirical evaluations on 53 forums verify: (a) the effectiveness of the classifiers with the automatically generated training data and (b) that the rareness and commonness of usernames can help user linking. We also analyze the cases where the classifiers fail.},
